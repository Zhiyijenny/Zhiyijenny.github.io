# About
![my photo](Poster.jpg)

I am a second-year [PhD student](https://arhusynergy.umd.edu/graduate-research/VoicesBlog#Secrets) in the [Second Language Acquisition program](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/zhiyi-jenny-wu) at University of Maryland - College Park (UMCP). I work with [Kira Gor](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/kira-gor) and [Nan Jiang](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/nan-jiang). My research interests include the learning and processing of second language phonology, lexical units, and syntax, from both the psycholinguistic and the neurolinguistic perspectives.

# **Research**
I'm interested in how the language(s) we already know affect how we process and learn a new language, and how the smaller units of the language are represented in the mind and the brain. 

## **Current Research**

**First-language Influence on Second-language Processing**

I am currently working on my first Qualifying paper, advised by Dr. Kira Gor and collaborating with Mireia Toda Cosi, for the PhD program on the influence of first-language phonology on the learning of second-language phonology as well as words. I examine and compare learners of Spanish who speak American English and Mandarin Chinese as their first languages. 


**Semantic Priming Effects in different word processing tasks**

In the meantime, I work with Ruirui Jia on a project looking at the second-language-to-first-language semantic priming effects by using both the more traditional Lexical Decision Task and the less influential Semantic Categorization Task.
