**Influence of Native-Language Allophony on Nonnative Phonemic and Phonolexical Representations**

Under the mentorship of [Kira Gor](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/kira-gor), I have been investigating the impact of phonemic and allophonic representations on the phonological and lexical processing of late language learners within the auditory domain. My research focused on learners of Spanish who speak American American English and Mandarin Chinese as their first languages/


**Semantic Priming Effects in different word processing tasks**

Working with [Nan Jiang](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/nan-jiang), I will investigate the nuances of semantic priming effects among second language learners by distinguishing between associative and semantic relatedness. 

**The Reliability of Psycholinguistic Measures**

For decades, psycholinguistic researchers have relied on various measures, particularly those based on reaction times, to gain insights into the human mind. However, recent studies have called into question the reliability of these long-standing tools. Under the guidance of [Bronson Hui](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/bronson-hui) and through collaboration with him, I have been investigating the reliability of psycholinguistic tasks, e.g., lexical decision, and exploring potential ways to improve it.

**The Acquisition of Lexical Tones by Second Language Learners**

Another research interest is the influence of various factors on late learners' perception and production of lexical tones, mainly in Mandarin Chinese.
