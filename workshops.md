# Data Analysis Workshops

I have taught a few workshops on different statistical analysis methods in psycholinguistics. Below are the workshops that have been taught. Some include teaching materials that you may find useful - the materials for the others may be added later. I am a loyal user of R, so all the methods in the workshops below are taught under the R framework. Feel free to email me if you want to change my mind about using R!

## Using Random Slopes as Measures

You should know how to run multilevel modeling by now. And you should know that using a multilevel model can control for the random effects, indexed by random slopes and intercepts of participants and/or items. However, do you know how to use the random slopes as measures of individual differences for further research?

For demos of how to run reliability analysis based on random slopes extracted from linear mixed-effects modeling, here are two testing cases:

[Testing case 1](RandomSlopes.html)

[Testing case 2](TestingCase2.html)

For a demo of how to use the random slopes extracted from linear mixed-effects modeling as a predictor individual difference measure to examine its predictive relationship with another outcome variable, here is one testing case:
