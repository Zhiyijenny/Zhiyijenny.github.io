![my photo](Bruno.jpg)

I am a psycholinguistic researcher and a [PhD candidate](https://arhusynergy.umd.edu/graduate-research/VoicesBlog#Secrets) in the [Second Language Acquisition program](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/zhiyi-jenny-wu) at the University of Maryland - College Park (UMCP). I work under the guidance of [Kira Gor](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/kira-gor), [Bronson Hui](https://bronson-hui.github.io/index.html), and [Nan Jiang](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/nan-jiang). My research focuses on the acquisition and processing of various aspects of second languages, with a focus on speech perception, phonology, and lexical units, from a psycholinguistic perspective. Additionally, I am interested in examining the reliability of psycholinguistic measures commonly used in second language research, aiming to contribute to developing more robust methodologies in the field.
