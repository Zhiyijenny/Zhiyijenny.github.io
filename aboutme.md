I am a psycholinguistic researcher and a fifth-year [PhD candidate](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/zhiyi-wu) in the [Second Language Acquisition program](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/zhiyi-jenny-wu) at the University of Maryland - College Park (UMCP). I work under the guidance of [Kira Gor](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/kira-gor), [Nan Jiang](https://sllc.umd.edu/directory/nan-jiang), and [Bronson Hui](https://bronson-hui.github.io/index.html). My research focuses on the acquisition and processing of various aspects of second language, including phonology, lexical units, and semantics, from a psycholinguistic perspective. Additionally, I am interested in examining the reliability of psycholinguistics measures commonly used in second language research, aiming to contribute to the development of more robust methodologies in the field.

In my free time, I love exploring nature through hiking, camping, foraging, and kayaking. 
When I am not outdoors, I enjoy playing with my six beloved kitties (2 best buddies named after Friends' characters, Joey and Chandler, 2 cutest sisters, Mango and Basil, and 2 grouchy ladies, Squeakers and Snickers), as well as a Sheltie puppy, Merlin, who joined the family only 6 months ago.
